1. Change the credentials used in [line 5](https://github.com/FranciscoGarciaNavarrete/buscador-centros/blob/main/src/common/services/liferay/api.js#L5) to the ones used in the environment where the app is running
2. Change the variable [apiPath](https://github.com/FranciscoGarciaNavarrete/buscador-centros/blob/main/src/common/services/liferay/api.js#L9) value to API's URL
